Description: 
------------

  This file gives some short information about the demo project for PDFUnit.

  PDFUnit is a tool to verify visible and invisible content of PDF documents.
  Also the layout can be validated. It provides a fluent API. 
  Internally it uses the features of JUnit, iText and some other products.
  

Homepage: 
---------
  See www.pdfunit.com


Installation of the demo project:
---------------------------------
  1. Extract the ZIP file containing this file into a folder.
  2. Import the project into Eclipse, if you like.

Running the existing tests:
---------------------------
  Some tests need a database access. Please start the database with
  the script 'startDemodb.bat' or 'startDemodb.sh'. 
  The scripts are located in the root of the project, the 
  database is located in the directory ./dbdata
  
  You can start the tests inside Eclipse or in a shell
    >ant test
    >mvn test
    >mvn site
  
  When you have started the tests, you will see the message
  'No license key found. Switching to evaluation mode.'
  'Contact PDFUnit.com if you are interested in a license.'
  on the console. 
  At the same time a small window with a math question opens.
  It may be that this window lays behind other application windows.
  So please search for that and answer the question.

  The number of tests in the evaluation mode is limited to 50 tests.

License:
--------
  You can evaluate PDFUnit as long as you want, but PDFUnit is
  a commercial product. So during the evaluation you have to answer 
  a little math question when running PDFUnit. If you have a
  license key file that question will not appear.
    
  When you give a wrong answer to the math question, all tests end with
  the exception 'com.pdfunit.internal.errors.PDFUnitLicenseError' 

  You can ask for a license:  license[at]pdfunit.com

Configuration:
--------------    
  The libraries of PDFUnit are located in the directory lib/pdfunit-<version>.
  This folder is named PDFUNIT_HOME in the following text.
  The libraries of third party libraries used by PDFUnit are located under 
  $PDFUNIT_HOME/lib/..

  PDFUnit comes with one config file: 'pdfunit.config'.
  See the manual (./docs/pdfunit-<version>_manual_<language>.pdf) for its usage.
  
  When the config file could not be found in the CLASSPATH, all
  tests end with 'junit.framework.AssertionFailedError'.  
    
Technical Infos:
----------------
  The project was developed with Eclipse.
  Java 1.7+ is required.
  PDFUnit runs under Windows and Linux and many JDK's.

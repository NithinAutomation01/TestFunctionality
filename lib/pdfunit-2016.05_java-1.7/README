Homepage: 
---------
  See www.pdfunit.com

Installation:
-------------
  Extract the file pdfunit-<version>_<date>.zip into a folder,
  for example into PROJECT_HOME/lib/pdfunit-<version>. In the following 
  description this folder is called "INSTALLATION".
    
  If you received a license key file, copy it to the same directory.
  Don't change the name of the license key file.
    
  Extend your CLASSPATH: 
  - INSTALLATION/pdfunit-<version>.jar
  - INSTALLATION/lib/*.jar
  - INSTALLATION     (the folder is needed, to read the license key file)

  Here an example for ANT:
   <path id="project.classpath">
      <pathelement location="${dir.external.tools.pdfunit}"/>
      <fileset dir="${dir.external.tools}">
        <include name="**/*.jar"/>
      </fileset>
      <pathelement location="${dir.build.classes}" />
    </path>
    
Update:
--------
  When you install a new version, you have to do the same steps.
  A license key file and the pdfunit-<version>.jar are corresponding to each other. 
  You can't use a new license key file with an older pdfunit-<version>.jar.
  
License:
--------
  PDFUnit is a commercial product. You can evaluate it as long as you want,
  but during the evaluation you have to answer a little math question after start.
  When using the license key file that question will not appear.
    
  When you give a wrong answer to the math question, all test end with
  the exception 'com.pdfunit.internal.errors.PDFUnitLicenseError' 
    
  You can ask for a license here:  info[@]pdfunit.com
    
Configuration:
--------------    
  PDFUnit comes with one config file: 'pdfunit.config'.
  See the manual (./docs/pdfunit-<version>_manual_<language>.pdf) for its usage.
  
  When the config file could not be found in the CLASSPATH, all
  tests end with 'junit.framework.AssertionFailedError'.  
    
Technical Infos:
----------------
